 ____________________________________
 
 This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
 This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
 be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM
 is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of
 the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version
 is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free
 Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
 under the Open Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common
 questions about using materials from our site, including specific terms and
 conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other questions about
 this notice can be directed to site-policy@w3.org.
